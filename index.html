          On April 7, 2015, CD PROJEKT RED announced two major expansions for
          The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, entitled Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.
          CD PROJEKT RED said that both expansion packs included new enemies,
          characters, and gear. Players would also be reunited with some "dearly
          missed" characters from the series. Hearts of Stone was released on
          October 13, 2015, and Blood and Wine on May 31, 2016, both are
          available on all three major platforms. Players can purchase both
          expansions at once by getting the Expansion Pass, now on sale through
          several retailers.

          Blood and Wine is a major expansion that adds over twenty hours of
          additional content. A tale that will introduce the all-new in-game
          region of Toussaint, Blood and Wine will take Geralt to a land
          untainted by war, where an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and
          knightly ritual masks an ancient and bloody secret.
